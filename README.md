# Voting System

## Description

The city of Pacopolis wants you to develop an electronic voting system. While the mayoral race between Pat Mann and Dawn Keykong is the most visible election, there are other elections and issues that will also need to be decided. And, of course, the electronic voting system must be usable in future elections, too.

The system shall allow a voter to identify themselves through authentication, after which they shall be presented with the ballot. After making their selections, the voter shall be offered the opportunity to review and change their selections. Once submitted, the voter's choices shall be recorded. The system shall prohibit a voter from voting more than once in the same election. At the end of the voting day, the system shall determine the winner of each election and the outcome of each issue.

While it shall be possible for a voter to later view their recorded vote to confirm that it was recorded correctly, and it shall be possible for a third party to determine whether a particular voter voted, it shall be impossible for a third party to determine how any particular voter voted.

The system shall allow an unlimited number of voters to vote from their own computers or from a shared computer at a polling location.

- The system may be implemented in text-mode or with a GUI.
